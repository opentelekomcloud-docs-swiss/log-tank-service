Overview
========

Logs reported from hosts and cloud services are retained in LTS for seven days and cannot be changed. Retained logs are deleted once the retention period is over. For long-term retention, you can transfer logs to Object Storage Service (OBS).

.. note::

   Log transfer refers to when logs are replicated to other cloud services. Retained logs are deleted once the retention period is over, but the logs that have been transferred to other services are not affected.
