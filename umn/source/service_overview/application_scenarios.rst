Application Scenarios
=====================

Log Collection and Analysis
---------------------------

When logs are scattered across hosts and cloud services and are periodically cleared, it is inconvenient to obtain the information you want. That's when LTS can come into play. LTS collects logs for unified management, and displays them on the LTS console in an intuitive and orderly manner. You can transfer logs for long-term storage. Collected logs can be quickly queried by keyword or fuzzy match. You can analyze real-time logs for security diagnosis and analysis, or obtain operations statistics, such as cloud service visits and clicks.

Service Performance Optimization
--------------------------------

The performance of website services (such as databases and networks) and quality of other services are important metrics for measuring customer satisfaction. With the network congestion logs provided by LTS, you can pinpoint the performance bottlenecks of your website. This helps you improve your website cache and network transmission policies, as well as optimize service performance. For example:

-  Analyzing historical website data to build a service network benchmark
-  Detecting service performance bottlenecks in time and properly expanding the capacity or degrading the traffic
-  Analyzing network traffic and optimizing network security policies

Quickly Locating Network Faults
-------------------------------

Network quality is the cornerstone of service stability. Logs are reported to LTS to ensure that you can view and locate faults in time. Then you can quickly locate network faults and perform network forensics. For example:

-  Quickly locating the root cause of an ECS, for example, an ECS with excessive bandwidth usage.
-  Determining whether services are attacked, unauthorized links are stolen, and malicious requests are sent through analyzing access logs, and locating and rectifying faults in time
