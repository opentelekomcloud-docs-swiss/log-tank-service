Introduction
============

Log Tank Service (LTS) enables you to collect logs from hosts and cloud services for centralized management, and efficiently, securely, and in real time. LTS provides you with the insights for optimizing the availability and performance of cloud services and applications. It allows you to make faster data-driven decisions, perform device O&M with ease, and analyze service trends.

Log Collection and Analysis
---------------------------

LTS collects logs from hosts and cloud services, and displays them on the LTS console in an intuitive and orderly manner. You can transfer logs for long-term storage. Collected logs can be quickly queried by keyword or fuzzy match. You can analyze real-time logs for security diagnosis and analysis, or obtain operations statistics, such as cloud service visits and clicks.
