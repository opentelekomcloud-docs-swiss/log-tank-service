Log Collection
==============

To reduce the memory, database, and disk space usage, you can set log collection as required. The log collection switch is used to determine whether to collect log data.

#. Log in to the LTS console, choose **Configuration Center** in the navigation pane on the left, and click the **Log Collection** tab.
#. Enable or disable **Log Collection**.

   .. note::

      This function is enabled by default. If you do not need to collect logs, disable this function to reduce resource usage.
