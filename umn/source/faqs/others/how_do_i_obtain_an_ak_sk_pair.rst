How Do I Obtain an AK/SK Pair?
==============================

An access key ID and secret access key (AK/SK) constitute an access key.

-  AK: unique access key ID associated with the SK. The AK and SK are used together to obtain an encrypted signature for a request.
-  SK: secret access key used in conjunction with an AK to sign requests cryptographically. It identifies a request sender and prevents the request from being modified.

Obtain and use the AK/SK of a public account.

.. note::

   Each user can create up to two AK/SK pairs. Once they are generated, they are permanently valid.

   Ensure that the public account and AK/SK will not be deleted or disabled. If the AK/SK is deleted, the ICAgent cannot report data to LTS.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the console, hover the mouse pointer over the username in the upper right corner, and select **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.
#. Click the **Access Keys** tab.
#. Click **Create Access Key**. In the displayed dialog box, enter the access key.
#. Click **OK**, and download the AK/SK immediately.

   .. note::

      Keep the AK/SK pair secure.
